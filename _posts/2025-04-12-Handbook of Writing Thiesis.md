## 1. Equation and symbol

Please enter formulas and symbols in **English input method** when you use the Japanese keyboard

### Common symbols
- Three types of dush
  - "-" hyphen

   **Input–Output Analysis usually use "*n-dush*".**


### Tips for using *Microsoft Word*
- Insert formula in *Microsoft Word*
  - Insert formula by using shortcut key `control` + `;`. 
  - Type `\alpha` and click the spacebar will show "$$\alpha$$"; Type `\beta` and click the spacebar will show "$$\beta$$". also for `\gamma`, `\delta`and so on.
  - `/` is called a slash, and `\` is called a backslash.
  - `¥` in Japanese keyborad is same to `\` in English keybord. That's means that enter `¥alpha` can show "$$\alpha$$" if you are using Japanese keyborad.
  - On a Mac Japanese keyboard, press `option` + `¥` to display a backslash `\`.


- Formulas with superscripts and subscripts: After inserting a formula in *Microsoft Word*,
  - Enter `z_ij` and click the spacebar, and "$$z_{ij}$$" will be displayed.
  - Enter `z^rs` and click the spacebar, and "$$z^{rs}$$" will be displayed.
  - First, enter `\alpha` to display "$$\alpha$$". Then, after "$$\alpha$$", enter `_ij` and press the spacebar. It will display " $$\alpha_{ij}$$ ".
  - Type `b\hat` , click the spacebar once to display "b^", and click the spacebar again to display "$$\hat{b}$$".




- Three types of dots in *Microsoft Word*
  - `\cdots` in word will show "$$\cdots$$"

## 2. Reference list

- Must use same reference style for all citation in your list.
- Reference styles include Harvard style, Chicago style, APA style (7th Edition) and so on. Chose one you like if there is no require from GSE office, and do not mix use them.
- If you want know some basic information about different reference styles, [Purdue Oneline Writing Lab: Research and Citation](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/resources.html) is a choice.
- Some tools can help you output reference list quickly in a specific style.
  - Google Scholar: 
    - Click on the `Cite` link next to your item.
    - Select your citation style.
    - Paste the citation into your working document.
  - Reference manager like *[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)*, *[Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/)*, *[EndNote](https://endnote.com/)* and so on can help you manage you reference and output a citation in specific style (Some of them are not free). 
  - I personally reconmend *[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/)* because it is free and can make synchronization very convenient by using the *[Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/)* for Browsers.
